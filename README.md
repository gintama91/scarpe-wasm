# Scarpe::Wasm

Scarpe is a re-implementation of the Shoes GUI library for Ruby with more modern dependencies and with support for current Ruby versions. Scarpe supports different swappable display libraries, allowing it to run with various devices.

Using Scarpe you can turn a few lines of code into a small GUI application.

The Wasm display library for Scarpe was initially written by Giovanni Borgh, and adopted by the Scarpe team generally.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add scarpe-wasm

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install scarpe-wasm

## Usage

(TBA, explain using wasify)

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
